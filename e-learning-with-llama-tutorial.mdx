# Building an AI-Enhanced E-Learning Platform with LLaMA 3.2 and 3.1, and Google Classroom Integration

## Introduction

Hey there! Itâ€™s Tommy again, and Iâ€™m excited to walk you through building something amazing today. In this tutorial, weâ€™re diving into the world of AI-powered education by creating a platform that uses [**LLaMA 3.2**](https://lablab.ai/tech/meta/llama-3.2) **Vision** and [**LLaMA 3.1**](https://lablab.ai/tech/meta/llama-3.1) models, integrated with **Google Classroom**. The result? A seamless system where users can upload images, automatically generate explanations, create quizzes, and even manage coursesâ€”completely AI-driven.

With the power of [**AI/ML API**](https://lablab.ai/tech/aiml-api) handling the heavy lifting and [**Streamlit**](https://lablab.ai/tech/streamlit) providing an intuitive interface, youâ€™ll see how easy it is to turn images into meaningful educational content. Whether youâ€™re an educator looking to automate course creation or just someone fascinated by the possibilities of AI in education, this tutorial has something for you.

Letâ€™s get started and transform the way learning happens! ðŸŽ“

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we dive into the code, letâ€™s set up our environment properly. Weâ€™ll start by creating a project folder, setting up a Conda environment, and installing the required dependencies.

### Step 1: Create and Enter the Project Folder

First, create a new folder for your project and navigate into it. I named mine **`llama-classroom`**, which will also be the name of our Conda environment.

### Step 2: Setting Up a Conda Environment

Now, create and activate a new Conda environment for this project:

```bash
conda create --name llama-classroom python=3.11
conda activate llama-classroom
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Add all required libraries to your `requirements.txt` file:

```txt
google-api-python-client
google-auth-httplib2
google-auth-oauthlib
streamlit
openai
```

Then, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Setting Up `.env` File

To work with **AI/ML API** and use the **LLaMA 3.1** and **LLaMA 3.2** models, youâ€™ll need to store your API key in a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line:

```txt
AI_ML_API_KEY=your_ai_ml_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_ai_ml_api_key_here` with your actual **AI/ML API** key. You can get it [here](https://aimlapi.com/app/keys/).

### Step 5: Google Classroom API Setup

To integrate with Google Classroom, you need to set up access through the Google Cloud Console. Follow the detailed steps in [this guide](https://developers.google.com/classroom/quickstart/python) to configure your Google Cloud project and generate a **`credentials.json`** file.

**Important Note**: When you download the OAuth credentials from the Google Cloud Console, the file may not be literally named **`credentials.json`**. You will need to rename the file to **`credentials.json`** for the code in this tutorial to work.

Make sure to place the renamed **`credentials.json`** file in your project directory, as it is essential for authenticating with the Google Classroom API. This file will be used to create a **`token.json`** file when you first run the code, which handles your login session and authorization.

Once you run any of the Google Classroom functions for the first time, a `token.json` file will be created, storing your login session and authorizing access. If you modify access scopes, you must delete this file and re-authenticate.

## Behind the Scenes: How It All Works

In this section, weâ€™ll go over the core functions used in this project, which are divided across two files: **`generation_functions.py`** and **`classroom_functions.py`**. Each function plays a specific role in handling the image analysis, course creation, quiz generation, and managing Google Classroom interactions.

### Step 1: Create the Necessary Files

Before we dive into explaining the functions, create the following files and add the content as provided:

1.  generation_functions.py

    ```python

        topic = re.search(r'Topic:\s*(.*)', text).group(1)
        explanation_match = re.search(r'Explanation:\s*(.*)', text, re.DOTALL)

        # Extract everything after "Explanation:" as the explanation
        explanation = explanation_match.group(1).strip()

        # Return the extracted values as a dictionary
        return {

- **`analyze_image_and_explain(image)`**:  
  We selected **LLaMA 3.2 Vision (90B)** for its ability to handle complex images and generate detailed, human-like explanations. With 90 billion parameters, itâ€™s ideal for breaking down educational visuals like scientific diagrams into clear, accurate descriptions, making it perfect for generating course material directly from images.

  This function sends an image to **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** for analysis. It returns a well-detailed explanation of the image, extracted using the `extract_course_info` function.

- **`extract_course_info(text)`**:  
  This helper function extracts relevant details from the text generated by LLaMA 3.2 Vision, such as the course name, description, and topic, and returns them as a dictionary.

- **`generate_mcqs_from_text(text)`**:  
  For quiz generation, we opted for **LLaMA 3.1 (70B Instruct)**. This model is fine-tuned to follow prompts precisely and generate structured content such as multiple-choice questions. Its 70 billion parameters ensure that it accurately converts the detailed explanations from **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** into reliable and well-formatted educational quizzes.

  This function takes the explanation generated by **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** and prompts **LLaMA 3.1** to create multiple-choice questions (MCQs). It returns the questions in JSON format.

  Adds a topic to the specified course based on the course ID and topic name.

- **`add_material_to_topic(course_id, topic_id, material_title, explanation)`**:  
  Posts the generated explanation as material under the specified topic in the course.

- **`post_quiz_to_classroom(course_id, topic_id, questions)`**:  
  Takes the MCQs generated by **LLaMA 3.1** and posts them to the course as a quiz.

- **`invite_student_to_course(course_id, student_name, student_email)`**:  
  Sends an invitation to the studentâ€™s email to join the course in Google Classroom.

## Bringing Everything Together: The Full Streamlit Frontend

Now that weâ€™ve set up the individual components for image analysis, quiz generation, and Google Classroom interaction, itâ€™s time to bring everything together in the **Streamlit** frontend. This file will allow users to upload images, generate explanations, create courses and quizzes, and invite studentsâ€”all through an intuitive interface.

Here is the full code for **`main.py`**, which ties together all the functions from **`generation_functions.py`** and **`classroom_functions.py`**.

```python

### **Explanation**

- Users can upload an image, which is analyzed by **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** to generate a detailed explanation.
- The explanation is used to create a course in Google Classroom, add materials, and generate MCQs using **LLaMA 3.1**.
- Finally, users can invite students to the course by entering their email and name.

## Running the Application

To launch the Streamlit application, open your terminal and navigate to the project folder. Youâ€™ll need to run Streamlit using the path to your Conda environment's `bin` directory. Hereâ€™s how I ran mine on my terminal in my current project directory:

```bash
/opt/anaconda3/envs/llama-classroom/bin/streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your browser. You should now be able to interact with the platform by uploading images, generating explanations, and more.

## Visualizing the Results: Output Showcase

To start, we upload an educational or scientific image. In this example, I uploaded an image of the **eye**, which will be used to generate a detailed explanation and create a course around this topic.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/e93f1000-2a4a-430d-be70-41d215c98c00/full" alt="Upload Image" caption="Image uploaded" />

After uploading the image, follow the numbered steps below:

### Steps:

1. **Generate Explanation**: Analyze the uploaded image and generate a detailed explanation.
2. **Create Course**: Use the generated explanation to create a new course in Google Classroom.
3. **Create Topic with Material**: Add the explanation as material in a topic within the course.
4. **Generate MCQs**: Generate multiple-choice questions based on the explanation.
5. **Invite Student**: Enter a student's email and name, then invite them to the course.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/a3822d7e-3763-4e8d-db06-f5865cf1d700/full" alt="Steps to create quiz" caption="Quiz creation and student invite steps" />

Get course link for the teacher when the **Create Course** button is pressed

Once all the buttons are pressed in sequence, the system will create a course in Google Classroom, publish the generated explanation as material under a topic, create and publish the multiple-choice quizzes, and invite the student to the course. The students will receive access to the course with all the content and quizzes ready for them to engage with.

In the student classwork section, the student should see all the published Multiple Choice questions and detailed material for the topic:

Also, the teacher should see published content, as well as now manage grades that the student turns in:

## Next Steps?

Here are a few ideas for enhancing the platform and extending its capabilities:

1. **AI-Powered Grading and Feedback**: Use **LLaMA 3.1** to automatically generate feedback for students' quiz responses, offering personalized insights and explanations.
2. **Dynamic Lesson Generation**: Extend **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** to generate more comprehensive lessons or courses from a variety of images, enabling educators to cover broader subjects automatically.
3. **Auto-Generated Assignments**: Have **LLaMA 3.1** create assignments or project ideas based on the course material to encourage deeper learning.
4. **Multimedia Analysis**: Expand **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** to analyze videos or complex diagrams for generating even more detailed educational content.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we built an AI-powered e-learning platform that uses the **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** model through **AI/ML API** to analyze images and generate detailed explanations. We then leveraged the **LLaMA 3.1** model to create multiple-choice quizzes based on the generated content. Additionally, we integrated this AI-driven system with **Google Classroom**, allowing us to automatically create courses, publish material, and invite studentsâ€”all through a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface.

For more information on further customizing and exploring the Google Classroom API, you can refer to the [Google Classroom Python API documentation](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/classroom/v1/python/latest/index.html).

Happy coding and learning! ðŸŽ‰
